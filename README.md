# I want people's first impression of my GitHub to be "Wow, he codes a lot!".
However, when people look at my GitHub page, sometimes I have 0 activity. Therefore, this script will automatically commit new changes to GitHub, making it seem like I am extremely active.

# Since you are actually reading this, you are not the target audience.
Thanks for taking the time to actually look at my portfolio. Hope you enjoy! :)

Feel free to use this script on your own machine. You have to set up a CronJob, but this is pretty simple. Just ask your LLM of choice for help!

* Note - for testing, you may want to change the probability of committing to be higher. You also have to manually push the code. You can automate the push process, but you have to set up the proper permissions in Cron, and doing it manually still counts all of the local commits you made.
